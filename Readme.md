# Ikea Tradfri + node.js

For reasons unknown to mankind requests never end and I have no idea how to close them.

## Getting started
You will need
- Linux
- a recent version of nodejs
- a tradfri gateway
- a tradfri remote
- a tradfri bulb
- a barcode scanner app
- a the IP of your gateway

You get the PSK by scanning the qr code on the bottom of the gateway.
It contains the MAC Adress of the bridge as well as that Key seperated by a ","
